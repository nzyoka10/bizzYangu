#### Problem Statement

Our business operates by selling items to resellers and consumers through field agents who take orders from them. These orders are then sent to our Customer Care (CC) center for processing. However, there is a recurring issue where some orders are not delivered or experience delays in delivery.

##### How Might We solutions - (HMW)

1. How might we ensure accurate and reliable delivery of scheduled orders?
2. How might we streamline and automate the order processing and delivery scheduling process to reduce errors and inefficiencies?

##### How Can We Solutions - (HCW)

1. Develop a centralized digital platform enabling real-time order tracking and inventory management for both field agents and the CC center. This platform should provide instant updates on stock availability and order status to prevent processing orders if items are out of stock.
2. Automate order processing by implementing algorithms to check stock availability, prepare invoices, and schedule deliveries automatically based on predefined criteria and parameters.
